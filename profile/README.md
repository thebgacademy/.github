# The Biodiversity Genomics Academy
## Free and Open education built by and for the Bioinformatics Community!

Welcome to The Biodiversity Genomics Academy (BGA)!

Here we are aiming to bring the best and brightest to give seminars and workshops in an online format. This will be free and open for anyone who wants to give it ago!

Our first year was [BGA23](BGA23.org) and this was a resounding success with 20 unique live sessions (40 sessions in total) and 1500 attendees from across the world!

For our second year, we are hoping to double this. 40 unique sessions at least. These will range from talks on specific topics to high-level workshops that you can join in on using GitPod (which is amazing!).

For now, we are in planning mode. If you'd like to be involved send me a message/issue and we will go from there.

We hope to see you this year at BGA24!
